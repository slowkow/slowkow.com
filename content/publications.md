<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Stroma is a broad term referring to the connective tissue
matrix in which other cells reside. It is composed of diverse cell types with
functions such as extracellular matrix maintenance, blood and lymph vessel
development, and effector cell recruitment. The tissue microenvironment is
determined by the molecular characteristics and relative abundances of
different stromal cells such as fibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes, and
mesenchymal precursor cells. Stromal cell heterogeneity is explained by
embryonic developmental lineage, stages of differentiation to other cell types,
and activation states. Interaction between immune and stromal cell types is
critical to wound healing, cancer, and a wide range of inflammatory diseases.
Here, we review recent studies of inflammatory diseases that use functional
genomics and single-cell technologies to identify and characterize stromal cell
types associated with pathogenesis.</p>

<p>RECENT FINDINGS: High dimensional strategies using mRNA sequencing, mass
cytometry, and fluorescence activated cell-sorting with fresh primary tissue
samples are producing detailed views of what is happening in diseased tissue in
rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. Fibroblasts
positive for CD90 (Thy-1) are enriched in the synovium of rheumatoid arthritis
patients, and also in prostate cancer tumors. Single-cell RNA-seq studies will
lead to more discoveries about the stroma in the near future.</p>

<p>SUMMARY: Stromal cells form the microenvironment of inflamed and diseased
tissues. Functional genomics is producing an increasingly detailed view of
subsets of stromal cells with pathogenic functions in rheumatic diseases and
cancer. Future genomics studies will discover disease mechanisms by perturbing
molecular pathways with chemokines and therapies known to affect patient
outcomes. Functional genomics studies with large sample sizes of patient
tissues will identify patient subsets with different disease phenotypes or
treatment responses.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h3>

<p>Fibroblasts regulate tissue homeostasis, coordinate inflammatory responses,
and mediate tissue damage. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), synovial fibroblasts
maintain chronic inflammation which leads to joint destruction. Little is
known about fibroblast heterogeneity or if aberrations in fibroblast subsets
relate to pathology. Here, we show functional and transcriptional differences
between fibroblast subsets from human synovial tissues using bulk
transcriptomics of targeted subpopulations and single-cell transcriptomics.
We identify seven fibroblast subsets with distinct surface protein
phenotypes, and collapse them into three subsets by integrating
transcriptomic data. One fibroblast subset, characterized by the expression
of proteins podoplanin, THY1 membrane glycoprotein and cadherin-11, but
lacking CD34, is threefold expanded in patients with RA relative to patients
with osteoarthritis. These fibroblasts localize to the perivascular zone in
inflamed synovium, secrete proinflammatory cytokines, are proliferative, and
have an in vitro phenotype characteristic of invasive cells. Our strategy may
be used as a template to identify pathogenic stromal cellular subsets in
other complex diseases.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h3>

<p>We created a fast, robust and general C++ implementation of a
single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set enrichment algorithm to identify cell
types, tissues and pathways affected by risk loci. It tests trait-associated
genomic loci for enrichment of specificity to conditions (cell types, tissues
and pathways). We use a non-parametric statistical approach to compute
empirical P-values by comparison with null SNP sets. As a proof of concept, we
present novel applications of our method to four sets of genome-wide
significant SNPs associated with red blood cell count, multiple sclerosis,
celiac disease and HDL cholesterol.</p>
