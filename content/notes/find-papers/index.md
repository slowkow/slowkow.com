There are millions of scientific publications, and many people have created
tools for exploring them. In this post, we'll highlight a few websites and
tools that allow us to search for text inside figures, view citation networks,
share public comments, and more.

Would you like to share another resource I missed? [Let me
know](https://twitter.com/slowkow), and I might consider adding to this list.

# CoCites: a citation-based method for searching scientific literature

https://cocites.com/

[Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cocites-beta/kjnhiadmccnbfbfjkmkhinglkaolnhcj)

> Co-cited is the co-citation frequency, indicating how many articles cite the
> article together with the query article. Similarity is the co-citation as
> percentage of the times cited of the query article or the article in the
> search results, whichever is the lowest. These numbers are calculated for the
> last 100 citations when articles are cited more than 100 times.

> Co-citations is the frequency with which two articles are cited together in
> the reference lists of other articles.
>
> Across many reference lists, we find that some articles are co-cited more
frequently than others. Articles that are frequently cited together tend to be
on a similar topic.
> 
> CoCites retrieves articles that cite an article of interest (the 'query
> article') and extracts all titles in their reference lists. CoCites counts how
> often each title appears in all reference lists and ranks them in descending
> order.

# Connected Papers: view a network of similar papers

https://www.connectedpapers.com

> Connected papers is a unique, visual tool to help researchers and applied
> scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work. To create
> each graph, we analyze an order of ~50,000 papers and select the few dozen
> with the strongest connections to the origin paper. In the graph, papers are
> arranged according to their similarity. That means that even papers that do
> not directly cite each other can be strongly connected and very closely
> positioned.

> Connected Papers is not a citation tree. Our similarity metric is
> based on the concepts of Co-citation and Bibliographic Coupling. According to
> this measure, two papers that have highly overlapping citations and
> references are presumed to have a higher chance of treating a related subject
> matter.

# Crossref: metadata for scholarly works

https://www.crossref.org

> Crossref makes research outputs easy to find, cite, link, assess, and reuse.

> We’re a not-for-profit membership organization that exists to make scholarly
> communications better. We rally the community; tag and share metadata; run an
> open infrastructure; play with technology; and make tools and services—all to
> help put scholarly content in context.

> We offer a wide array of services to ensure that scholarly research metadata
> is registered, linked, and distributed. When members register their content
> with us, we collect both bibliographic and non-bibliographic metadata. We
> process it so that connections can be made between publications, people,
> organizations, and other associated outputs. We preserve the metadata we
> receive for the scholarly record. We also make it available across a range of
> interfaces and formats so that the community can use it and build tools with
> it.

# Viziometrics: search for text inside figures

http://www.viziometrics.org/?keywords=PD-L1&art_view=false

> In this project, we use techniques from computer vision and machine learning
> to classify more than 8 million figures from PubMed into 5 figure types and
> study the resulting patterns of visual information as they relate to impact.
> We find that the distribution of figures and figure types in the literature
> has remained relatively constant over time, but can vary widely across field
> and topic. We find a significant correlation between scientific impact and
> the use of visual information, where higher impact papers tend to include
> more diagrams, and to a lesser extent more plots and photographs.
