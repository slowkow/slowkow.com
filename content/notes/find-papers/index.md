There are many ongoing efforts to create websites and tools for exploring the
scientific literature. In this post, we'll consider some of the currently
available tools that allow us to search for text inside figures, view citation
networks, share comments, and access the full text.

# Sci-Hub

Search the web for "sci-hub" to find a URL that works for you.

> the first pirate website in the world to provide mass and public access to
> tens of millions of research papers

Many scientists agree that Sci-Hub might be the single most important resource
for finding research papers. This is one of the most popular ways for
researchers to access full text PDF files for free.

# Viziometrics

http://www.viziometrics.org/?keywords=PD-L1&art_view=false

> In this project, we use techniques from computer vision and machine learning
> to classify more than 8 million figures from PubMed into 5 figure types and
> study the resulting patterns of visual information as they relate to impact.
> We find that the distribution of figures and figure types in the literature
> has remained relatively constant over time, but can vary widely across field
> and topic. We find a significant correlation between scientific impact and
> the use of visual information, where higher impact papers tend to include
> more diagrams, and to a lesser extent more plots and photographs.

[University of Washington](http://www.washington.edu/).
