There are millions of scientific publications, and many people have created
tools for exploring them. In this post, we'll highlight a few websites and
tools that allow us to search for text inside figures, view citation networks,
share public comments, and more.

<!--more-->

Would you like to share another resource I missed? {{< bluesky "Let me know" >}}, and I might consider adding to this list.

## EVEX: search for bio-molecular events across millions of articles

http://www.evexdb.org/

> EVEX is a text mining resource built on top of PubMed abstracts and PubMed
> Central full texts. It contains over 40 million bio-molecular events among
> more than 76 million automatically extracted gene/protein name mentions. The
> text mining data further has been enriched with gene normalization results,
> allowing straightforward integration with external resources. Further, gene
> families from Ensembl and HomoloGene provide homology-based event
> generalizations. EVEX presents both direct and indirect associations between
> genes and proteins, enabling explorative browsing of relevant literature.

## Viziometrics: search for text inside figures

http://www.viziometrics.org/?keywords=PD-L1&art_view=false

> In this project, we use techniques from computer vision and machine learning
> to classify more than 8 million figures from PubMed into 5 figure types and
> study the resulting patterns of visual information as they relate to impact.
> We find that the distribution of figures and figure types in the literature
> has remained relatively constant over time, but can vary widely across field
> and topic. We find a significant correlation between scientific impact and
> the use of visual information, where higher impact papers tend to include
> more diagrams, and to a lesser extent more plots and photographs.

# Publishing platform

## Peeriodicals: your own curated collections of publications

https://peeriodicals.com/


> A peeriodical is a lightweight virtual journal with you as the
> Editor-in-chief, giving you complete freedom in setting editorial policy to
> select the most interesting and useful manuscripts for your readers. The
> manuscripts you will evaluate and select are existing publications—preprints
> and papers. Thus, a peeriodical replicates all the functions of a traditional
> journal, including discovery, selection and certification, except publication
> itself.

# Citation network

## CoCites: a citation-based method for searching scientific literature

https://cocites.com/

[Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cocites-beta/kjnhiadmccnbfbfjkmkhinglkaolnhcj)

> Co-cited is the co-citation frequency, indicating how many articles cite the
> article together with the query article. Similarity is the co-citation as
> percentage of the times cited of the query article or the article in the
> search results, whichever is the lowest. These numbers are calculated for the
> last 100 citations when articles are cited more than 100 times.

<div class="mw6 center">

> Co-citations is the frequency with which two articles are cited together in
> the reference lists of other articles.
>
> Across many reference lists, we find that some articles are co-cited more
frequently than others. Articles that are frequently cited together tend to be
on a similar topic.
> 
> CoCites retrieves articles that cite an article of interest (the 'query
> article') and extracts all titles in their reference lists. CoCites counts how
> often each title appears in all reference lists and ranks them in descending
> order.

## Connected Papers: view a network of similar papers

https://www.connectedpapers.com

> Connected papers is a unique, visual tool to help researchers and applied
> scientists find and explore papers relevant to their field of work. To create
> each graph, we analyze an order of ~50,000 papers and select the few dozen
> with the strongest connections to the origin paper. In the graph, papers are
> arranged according to their similarity. That means that even papers that do
> not directly cite each other can be strongly connected and very closely
> positioned.

> Connected Papers is not a citation tree. Our similarity metric is
> based on the concepts of Co-citation and Bibliographic Coupling. According to
> this measure, two papers that have highly overlapping citations and
> references are presumed to have a higher chance of treating a related subject
> matter.
