There are millions of scientific publications, and many people have created
tools for exploring them. In this post, we'll highlight a few websites and
tools that allow us to search for text inside figures, view citation networks,
share public comments, and more.

# CoCites

[Google Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cocites-beta/kjnhiadmccnbfbfjkmkhinglkaolnhcj)

> Co-cited is the co-citation frequency, indicating how many articles cite the
> article together with the query article. Similarity is the co-citation as
> percentage of the times cited of the query article or the article in the
> search results, whichever is the lowest. These numbers are calculated for the
> last 100 citations when articles are cited more than 100 times.

> Co-citations is the frequency with which two articles are cited together in
> the reference lists of other articles.
>
> Across many reference lists, we find that some articles are co-cited more
frequently than others. Articles that are frequently cited together tend to be
on a similar topic.
> 
> CoCites retrieves articles that cite an article of interest (the 'query
> article') and extracts all titles in their reference lists. CoCites counts how
> often each title appears in all reference lists and ranks them in descending
> order.

# Peeriodicals

https://peeriodicals.com/

> A peeriodical is a lightweight virtual journal with you as the
> Editor-in-chief, giving you complete freedom in setting editorial policy to
> select the most interesting and useful manuscripts for your readers. The
> manuscripts you will evaluate and select are existing publications—preprints
> and papers. Thus, a peeriodical replicates all the functions of a traditional
> journal, including discovery, selection and certification, except publication
> itself.

# Viziometrics

http://www.viziometrics.org/?keywords=PD-L1&art_view=false

> In this project, we use techniques from computer vision and machine learning
> to classify more than 8 million figures from PubMed into 5 figure types and
> study the resulting patterns of visual information as they relate to impact.
> We find that the distribution of figures and figure types in the literature
> has remained relatively constant over time, but can vary widely across field
> and topic. We find a significant correlation between scientific impact and
> the use of visual information, where higher impact papers tend to include
> more diagrams, and to a lesser extent more plots and photographs.
