It has been reported that severe cases with CVA2 infection develop \ninto heart injury, which may be one of the causes of death. However, the \nmechanisms of CVA2-induced heart injury have not been well understood. In this \nstudy, we used a neonatal mouse model of CVA2 to investigate the possible \nmechanisms of heart injury. We detected CVA2 replication and apoptosis in heart \ntissues from infected mice. The activity of total aspartate transaminase (AST) \nand lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was notably increased in heart tissues from \ninfected mice. CVA2 infection also led to the disruption of cell-matrix \ninteractions in heart tissues, including the increases of matrix \nmetalloproteinase (MMP)3, MMP8, MMP9, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and \ntissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP)4. Infiltrating leukocytes (CD45+ \nand CD11b+ cells) were observed in heart tissues of infected mice. \nCorrespondingly, the expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in tissue \nlysates of hearts, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Î±), \ninterleukin-1beta (IL-1Î²), IL6 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) \nwere significantly elevated in CVA2 infected mice. Inflammatory signal pathways \nin heart tissues, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT, \nmitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB), \nwere also activated after infection. In summary, CVA2 infection leads to heart \ninjury in a neonatal mouse model, which might be related to viral replication, \nincreased expression levels of MMP-related enzymes and excessive inflammatory \nresponses.",

In order to better \nunderstand the molecular mechanisms of CVB3 2A's function, the yeast two-hybrid \n(Y2H) system was adopted to screen for CVB3 2A interactive proteins in the human \nheart cDNA library. Full-length 2A shows strong transcriptional activity in \nyeast cells, which interferes with the application of Y2H system; therefore, a \nseries of 2A deletion mutants were constructed. Analysis of transcriptional \nself-activation revealed that 2A lost its transcriptional activity after \ntruncation of 60 amino acids (aa) at the N-terminus or deletion of 17 aa at the \nC-terminus. Choosing the 2A mutant with 17 aa deletion at the C-terminus as the \nbait protein, four interactive cellular proteins were identified, including \nTIMP4, MYL2, COX7C, and ENO1. These proteins are mostly related to protein \ndegradation and metabolism. Although the interactions detected by the Y2H system \nshould be considered as preliminary results, the finding of proteins translated \nfrom a human heart cDNA library that interacts with the CVB3 2A will stimulate \nexperiments testing the reactivity of a translational mixture derived from that \nlibrary with full-length 2A protein, followed by co-immunoprecipitation studies.",

Different MMP promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms \n(SNPs) induce changes in MMP genes, mRNA and protein expression. Gender might \nalso modify MMP plasma levels. In order to determine the weight of these \nvariables on MMP secretion we studied MMP-1, -2, -3, -8, -9, -10, -13 and \nTIMP-1, -2, -4 plasma levels in 90 patients with severe bacterial sepsis, 102 \nwith anti-retroviral (ARV)-treated HIV monoinfection, 111 with ARV-treated \nHIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection and 86 non-infected controls (45 stroke \nand 41 trauma patients).

MMP-3 plasma levels \nwere significantly higher in men than in women in each diagnostic group, and \nMMP-3 SNP allele 6A carriers also had higher levels than allele 5A carriers, an \neffect that was magnified by sepsis. Independent predictors of higher MMP-3 \nlevels were male gender (P = 0.0001), MMP-3(-1612 5A/6A) SNP (P = 0.001), higher \nlevels of TIMP-4 (P = 0.004) and MMP-8 (P = 0.006) and lower levels of MMP-1 (P \n= 0.03) by multivariate analysis. No strong associations with gender or SNPs \nwere observed for other MMPs or TIMPs. In conclusion, male gender and \nMMP-3(-1612 5A/6A) 6A allele carriage increased MMP-3 plasma levels \nsignificantly, especially in patients with severe bacterial sepsis.

A uniform \nreduction in TIMP-4 post-MI has been observed.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine post-MI remodeling with cardiac-restricted overexpression \nof TIMP-4, either through a transgenic or viral delivery approach.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: MI was induced in mice and then randomized to targeted \ninjection of an adenoviral construct (10 Î¼L; 8Ã—10(9) plaque forming units/mL) \nencoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the full-length human TIMP-4 \n(Ad-GFP-TIMP4) or GFP. A transgenic construct with cardiac-restricted \noverexpression TIMP-4 (hTIMP-4exp) was used in a parallel set of studies. LV \nend-diastolic volume, an index of LV remodeling, increased by >60% from baseline \nat 5 days post-MI and by >100% at 21 days post-MI in the Ad-GFP only group. \nHowever, LV dilation was reduced by â‰ˆ50% in both the Ad-GFP-TIMP4 and hTIMP-4exp \ngroups at these post-MI time points. LV ejection fraction was improved with \neither Ad-GFP-TIMP-4 or hTIMP-4exp. Fibrillar collagen expression and content \nwere increased within the MI region with both TIMP-4 interventions, suggestive \nof matrix stabilization.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to demonstrate that selective myocardial \ntargeting for TIMP-4 induction through either a viral or transgenic approach \nfavorably altered the course of adverse LV remodeling post-MI. Thus, localized \ninduction of endogenous matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, such as TIMP-4, \nholds promise as a means to interrupt the progression of post-MI remodeling.",

Gelatin \nzymography was used to detect the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the CSF. \nNeurosyphilis was defined as a CSF white blood cell count â‰¥ 20 cells/Î¼L or a \nreactive CSF Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL). All the patients with \nHIV-S were males. Most (85%) had sex with men (MSM) and serum rapid plasma \nreagin (RPR) titers of â‰¥ 1:32. The median age was 35 years (IQR 30-43). The \nmedian CD4 T cell counts at the time of the diagnosis of syphilis were 270 \ncells/Î¼L (IQR 96-484). Ten patients (50%) had neurosyphilis based on a reactive \nCSF VDRL test (n=8) or increased CSF white cell counts â‰¥ 20/Î¼L (n=2). The \nconcentrations of CSF MMP-9, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were significantly higher in \npatients with HIV-S than the controls (P<0.05). The CSF TIMP-4 concentrations \nwere significantly lower in those with HIV-S (452 pg/ml) than controls (3101 \npg/ml), P<0001. There were no significant differences in serum concentrations \nbetween the groups. The only finding that distinguished HIV-1 patients with from \nthose without neurosyphilis is a significant higher expression of CSF MMP-9. In \nconclusion, the MMP/TIMP system was found to be dysregulated in patients with \nHIV-S regardless of whether they met the laboratory definition of neurosyphilis. \nThe CSF level of MMP-9 was the only measure that distinguished those with or \nwithout neurosyphilis.",

//         "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatic fibrosis leading to cirrhosis is the major morbidity in \npatients with biliary atresia (BA). This fibrosis is due to an imbalance in \nextracellular matrix (ECM) breakdown and deposition. We have previously \ndemonstrated increased mRNA expression for inhibitors of ECM breakdown without \nincreased expression for mediators of ECM deposition in our animal model of BA \nby d 14. However, only a mild degree of hepatic fibrosis was seen at this time. \nWe hypothesized that expression patterns for these proteins may change once more \nsignificant fibrosis had been established, and added resuscitation to the model \nto improve survival. Interestingly, we found that some mice spontaneously \nrecovered at later time points with resuscitation, and thus compared expression \nfor inhibitors of ECM breakdown and deposition in sick and recovered mice to \ndetermine the differences.\nMETHODS: Newborn Balb/c mice received an intraperitoneal injection 1.0 x 10(6) \nfluorescence forming units of rhesus rotavirus 24h after birth. Mice were \nmonitored daily for weight gain, development of jaundice, acholic stools, and \nbilirubinuria. Fifty muL/g of 5% dextrose in normal saline were subcutaneously \ninjected daily to each mouse starting on d 7 until sacrifice. Mice that survived \npast d 14 were sacrificed at d 21 after saline or RRV infection. Livers were \nthen harvested post-injection d 21 for histologic and immunohistochemical \nanalysis. RNA expression of known mediators of fibrosis was evaluated using \nquantitative real-time PCR. Protein expression was assessed using ELISA. Weights \nand normally distributed data were compared using Student's t test. Histologic \nfindings were compared using Fisher's exact test. Comparisons of gene expression \nand skewed data were performed by the Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical \nsignificance was assigned to any P value less than 0.05.\nRESULTS: Daily resuscitation resulted in a 35% (24/68) survival rate to d 21 in \nour model. Mice that recovered were significantly heavier than those that \nremained ill on d 14 (6.15 +/- 1.16 versus 4.94 +/- 0.82, P = 0.02) and 21 (7.31 \n+/- 1.41 versus 4.14 +/- 0.53, P < 0.001) despite the fact that there was no \ndifference between the groups with respect to weight on d 7 (4.29 +/- 0.90 \nversus 3.89 +/- 0.81, P = 0.32). We found that all (10/10) animals that \ndisplayed clinical signs of biliary atresia on d 21 had moderate or severe \nhistologic findings, while only one (1/9) of the recovered animals had liver \nabnormalities at sacrifice (P < 0.001 versus sick group). We also found that the \nsick mice had statistically significant median fold-increases of mRNA expression \nfor TIMP-1 (31.9 versus 9.1, P = 0.041), TIMP-4 (88.1 versus 1.8, P = 0.022), \nand MMP-7 (51.8 versus 11.9, P = 0.006) compared with those that recovered. \nThere was a trend toward decreased mRNA expression for PAI-1, which did not \nreach statistical significance (median 27.7 versus 2.19, P = 0.066). Increased \nprotein expression for TIMP-1 and PAI-1 were also found in the sick group. The \nmRNA expression for the fibrillar collagens, fibronectin-1, connective tissue \ngrowth factor, snail-1, TIMP-2 and -3, and MMP-2 and MMP-9 was not different in \nthe sick and recovered groups 21 d after RRV infection, and was not elevated \nfrom baseline gene expression.\nCONCLUSIONS: With resuscitation added to the animal model of BA, some mice \nspontaneously recover while others progress to more significant hepatic \nfibrosis. Mice with hepatic fibrosis have a continued increase in mRNA \nexpression of TIMP-1, TIMP-4, and MMP-7, with a trend toward increased mRNA \nexpression of PAI-1 on d 21. Protein levels for TIMP-1 and PAI-1 were also \nincreased in the sick mice. Recovered mice display mild to no hepatic \nparenchymal disease and a normal pattern of mRNA expression for the mediators of \nfibrosis tested. No increase in mRNA expression for the mediators of ECM \ndeposition was found in either group. These data further support the notion that \ninhibition of ECM breakdown alone is sufficient to induce hepatic fibrosis. \nModulation of this process may be a putative target for preventing liver injury \nin patients with BA.",

The underlying mechanisms \nhave not been defined. We used an animal model of BA to evaluate mediators of \nextracellular matrix (ECM) processing to determine which factors may be \ninvolved.\nMETHODS: Newborn BALB/c mice received an intraperitoneal injection with rhesus \nrotavirus or saline within 24 h of birth. Livers were harvested on days 7 and 14 \nfor histology and immunohistochemistry (IHC). RNA expression was determined \nusing quantitative real-time PCR. Human liver from patients with BA and those \nhaving a resection for nonfibrosing diseases was also evaluated.\nRESULTS: In experimental mice, mRNA expression for tissue inhibitor of \nmetalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 was increased \n18-fold and 69-fold, respectively on day 7, with further increases on day 14. On \nday 14, mRNA expression for plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 (38-fold), \nTIMP-4 (9.5-fold), and MMP-9 (5.5-fold) mRNA was also observed.

In the mouse model, the inflammatory phase of myocarditis results in \nextensive damage to the heart and triggers profound extracellular matrix (ECM) \nremodeling, which may ultimately lead to dilated cardiomyopathy. Matrix \nmetalloproteinases (MMPs) are regulators of the ECM and can degrade all the \ncomponents in the matrix.\nMETHODS: Adolescent male mice were infected with cardiovirulent CVB3 and \nsacrificed at 3, 9, and 30 days post infection (pi). Transcription of MMP-2, \nMMP-9, and MMP-12 was assessed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain \nreaction (RT-PCR). Protein expression of these enzymes was examined using \nimmunohistochemistry, and the activation status of MMP-2 and MMP-9 was assessed \nusing gelatin zymography. Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) were \nanalyzed using immunoblotting assays. Myocarditic hearts were also stained with \npicrosirius red and viewed under polarizing light to examine the collagen \nnetwork.\nRESULTS: MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-12 transcription was increased at 9 days pi, as \ndetermined by RT-PCR. Immunohistochemistry confirmed an increase in translation \nof these MMP species, and zymographic analysis further showed elevated \nactivation of MMP-2 and MMP-9 following CVB3 infection. TIMP-3 and TIMP-4 \nexpression was down-regulated, while TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 remained constant \nthroughout the infection. Mouse hearts stained with picrosirius red showed an \nincrease in total amount of collagen during the acute phase of infection and \ndisrupted fibrils at later timepoints.\nCONCLUSION: After CVB3 infection, ECM remodeling is triggered, and this response \nmay involve increased expression and activation of MMPs.",

In \ncarvedilol-treated mice, a significant improvement in left ventricular function \nwas documented 10 days post infection. In infected mice (n=10), IL-1beta, \nTNF-alpha, TGF-beta(1) and IL-10 myocardial mRNA abundance were increased \nsignificantly (240%, 200%, 161%, and 230%) compared to controls (n=10), while \nIL-15 mRNA was markedly reduced (70%).

Therefore, we hypothesized that a tissue \nspecific tumor suppressor exists in the heart. To test this hypothesis we \nprepared cardiac tissue extracts from normal (n = 4), ischemic cardiomypathic \n(ICM) [n = 5], and dilated cardiomyopathic (DCM) [n = 8] human heart end-stage \nexplants. The level of cardiospecific TIMP-4 was determined by SDS-PAGE and \nWestern-blot analysis. The results suggested reduced levels of TIMP-4 in ICM and \nDCM as compared to normal heart. TIMP-4 was purified by reverse phase HPLC and \ngelatin-sepharose affinity chromatography. Collagenase inhibitory activity of \nchromatographic peaks was determined using fluorescein-conjugated collagen as \nsubstrate and fluorescence spectroscopy. The activity of TIMP-4 (27 kDa) was \ncharacterized by reverse zymography. The role of TIMP-4 in cardiac fibroblast \ncell migration was examined using Boyden chamber analysis. The results suggested \nthat TIMP-4 inhibited cardiac fibroblast cells migration and collagen gel \ninvasion. To test whether TIMP-4 induces apoptosis, we cultured cardiac normal \nand polyomavirus transformed fibroblast cells in the presence and absence of \nTIMP-4. The number of cells were measured and DNA laddering was determined. The \nresults suggested that TIMP-4 controlled normal cardiac fibroblast \ntransformation and induced apoptosis in transformed cells. Cardiospecific TIMP-4 \nplays a significant role in regulating the normal cell phenotype. The reduced \nlevels of TIMP-4 elicit cellular transformation and may lead to adverse \nextracellular matrix degradation (remodeling), cardiac hypertrophy and failure. \nThis study suggests a possible protective role of TIMP-4 in other organs which \nare susceptible to malignancy.",

//         "abstract": "The dynamic process of mammary ductal morphogenesis depends on regulated \nepithelial proliferation and extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover. Epithelial \ncell-matrix contact closely dictates epithelial proliferation, differentiation, \nand survival. Despite the fact that tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases \n(Timps) regulate ECM turnover, their function in mammary morphogenesis is \nunknown. We have delineated the spatiotemporal expression of all Timps (Timp-1 \nto Timp-4) during discrete phases of murine mammary development. Timp mRNAs were \nabundant in mammary tissue, each displaying differential expression patterns \nwith predominant localization in luminal epithelial cells. Timp-1 mRNA was \nunique in that its expression was limited to the stage at which epithelial \nproliferation was high. To assess whether Timp-1 promotes or inhibits epithelial \ncell proliferation we manipulated mammary Timp-1 levels, genetically and \nbiochemically. Down-regulation of epithelial-derived Timp-1 in transgenic mice, \nby mouse mammary tumor virus promoter-directed Timp-1 antisense RNA expression, \nled to augmented ductal expansion and increased number of ducts (P < 0.004). In \nthese transgenics the integrity of basement membrane surrounding epithelial \nducts, as visualized by laminin-specific immunostaining, was breached. In \ncontrast to these mice, ductal expansion was markedly attenuated in the \nproximity of implanted recombinant Timp-1-releasing pellets (rTIMP-1), without \nan increase in basement membrane deposition around migrating terminal end buds. \nEpithelial proliferation and apoptosis were measured to determine the basis of \naltered ductal expansion. Luminal epithelial proliferation was increased by 55% \n(P < 0.02) in Timp-1-reduced transgenic mammary tissue and, conversely, \ndecreased by 38% (P < 0.02) in terminal end buds by implanted rTIMP-1. \nEpithelial apoptosis was minimal and remained unaffected by Timp-1 \nmanipulations. We conclude that Timps have an integral function in mammary \nmorphogenesis and that Timp-1 regulates mammary epithelial proliferation in \nvivo, at least in part by maintaining basement membrane integrity.",
