- Hello! I'm Kamil Slowikowski, the creator of ggrepel.

- I'm also a PhD student in Bioinformatics at Harvard.

- I want to show you a brief introduction to ggrepel, so you can get started
  using it in your figures.

# &amp;#x1F61E; **Problem:** text placement

.pull-left[
&lt;br&gt;

```r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(
    x = wt, y = mpg,
    label = rownames(mtcars)
  ) + 
  geom_point(color = "red") +
* geom_text()
```
]

.pull-right[
![](index_files/figure-html/problem-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]


???

- Oftentimes, we want to know the identity of each data point in a figure.

- Unfortunately, `geom_text()` does not always work as expected:
  
  - text labels often overlap with each other
    
  - sometimes they fall outside the plotting area

---

# &amp;#x1F389; **Solution:** ggrepel

.pull-left[
&lt;br&gt;

```r
library(ggrepel)

ggplot(mtcars) + 
  aes(
    x = wt, y = mpg,
    label = rownames(mtcars)
  ) + 
  geom_point(color = "red") +
* geom_text_repel()
```
]

.pull-right[
![](index_files/figure-html/solution-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

???

- This problem motivated me to create ggrepel:
  
  - an extension for ggplot2 that automatically places text labels without
    overlaps

- I tried to make it very easy to use:

  - just replace `geom_text()` with `geom_text_repel()`

---

# &amp;#x1F60A; Much better!

![](index_files/figure-html/ex1-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

???

- Side by side, you can see that the figure using ggrepel is much
  easier to read because the text is clearly visible.

---

# **Repel** text labels away from

.pull-left-large[
&lt;br&gt;
- other text labels

- data points

- edges of the plotting area
]

.pull-right[
![](index_files/figure-html/ex2-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]


???

- The idea behind ggrepel is very simple.

- We want to repel text labels away from:

  - other text labels

  - data points

  - and edges of the plotting area

---

# &amp;#x1F4DC; Algorithm

.large[
`\(O(n^2)\)` N-body physical simulation
]

![](index_files/figure-html/algorithm-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

???

- I implemented a brute force algorithm of a physical simulation.

- We iterate over all pairs of text labels and repel them away from each other.

- We use a spring force to pull each text label back to its own data point.

- Let's see it in action!

---

# &amp;#x1F40E; **ggrepel** in action

&lt;video src="index_files/animation.mp4" type="video/mp4" style="height:75%; margin-left:8%;" muted autoplay loop&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

???

- This is an animation showing each step of the simulation on a loop.

- The labels repel away from each other, and away from data points.

- There is a spring force that pulls each label back to its own data point.

- Notice that "Honda Civic" first moves away from its data point, and then
  it is pulled back until it is directly adjacent.

---

# &amp;#x1F40E; **ggrepel** in action

&lt;video src="index_files/resizing.mp4" type="video/mp4" style="height:70%; margin-left:8%;" muted autoplay loop&gt;&lt;/video&gt;

???

- ggrepel works well with RStudio.

- When you resize the plotting area, it will automatically recompute
  the overlaps and adjust the label positions.

---

# &amp;#x1F4BE; Installation

.pull-left-large[
Install **ggrepel** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ggrepel):


```r
install.packages("ggrepel")
```

]

.pull-right[
![](index_files/figure-html/downloads-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

???

- ggrepel is easy to install and only depends on ggplot2. It has no
  other dependencies.

- This has quickly become the most popular piece of code I have ever written.

- I've learned that people are happy when something just works.

- Now let's take a look at a practical example.

---

# &amp;#x1F30B; Example: Volcano

.large[Which genes show significant differential expression?]

![](index_files/figure-html/volcano-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;

Thanks to [Stephen Turner] for the example data.

[Stephen Turner]: http://www.gettinggeneticsdone.com/2016/01/repel-overlapping-text-labels-in-ggplot2.html

???

- In bioinformatics, we often do a differential gene expression test.

- Then, we ask: which genes show significant differential expression?

- With ggrepel, we can actually read the gene names. That's great.

- However, these figures are not always easy to read.
  
- Sometimes ggrepel is not the best choice...

---

# &amp;#x1F914; Consider other options

.pull-left-large[
- **ggrepel** is not always the best choice

- Sometimes other plots are easier to read
]

.pull-right[
![](index_files/figure-html/lollipop-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

???

- It is not always a good idea to add text labels to your figure.

- Sometimes other plots are easier to read.

- If possible, try to keep your figures easy to understand.

- Because if you're not careful, you might get a surprising result...

---

# &amp;#x1F92D; Don't label too many points!

.large[
Or else you will end up with [@accidental__aRt]
]

&lt;div class="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="index_files/accidental-art-1.png" alt="" style="width: 66%;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

[@accidental__aRt]: https://twitter.com/accidental__aRt

???

- I see a lot of figures in the wild with too many text labels!

- To avoid this situation, you might consider labeling a small subset of your
  data points.

---

# &amp;#x1F4A1; Use the empty string ""

.pull-left[

```r
library(ggrepel)
d &lt;- subset(
  mtcars, wt &gt; 3 &amp; wt &lt; 4
)
# Just label 3 items.
*d$car &lt;- ""
*i &lt;- c(2, 3, 16)
*d$car[i] &lt;- rownames(d)[i]

ggplot(d) +
  aes(wt, mpg, label = car) +
  geom_point(
    color = ifelse(
      d$car != "",
      "red", "grey50"
    )
  ) +
  geom_text_repel()
```
]


.pull-right[
![](index_files/figure-html/empty-1.png)&lt;!-- --&gt;
]

???

- You can use the empty string to hide most of the labels.

- Then you can add labels for just a few data points.

- By using the empty string strategy, we are saying that we want the unlabeled
  data points to continue repelling the text from the labeled data points.

- I wish I had these resources when I started developing ggrepel.

- Hadley's guide will show you how to make an extension, step by step.

- Elio's guide will show you how to make a very generic extension that
  works with any function which accepts a dataframe as input and produces
  a similar dataframe as output.

- Finally, if you want to learn more about the internals of ggplot, be sure to
  look at Brodie's guide. It is the most comprehensive and detailed resource
  about how ggplot2 works.
