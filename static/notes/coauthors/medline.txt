TI  - Using genetics to prioritize diagnoses for rheumatology outpatients with
      inflammatory arthritis.
LID - eaay1548 [pii]

AB  - It is challenging to quickly diagnose slowly progressing diseases. To
      prioritize multiple related diagnoses, we developed G-PROB (Genetic
      Probability tool) to calculate the probability of different diseases for
      a patient using genetic risk scores. We tested G-PROB for inflammatory
      arthritis-causing diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
      erythematosus, spondyloarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis, and gout). After
      validating on simulated data, we tested G-PROB in three cohorts: 1211
      patients identified by International Classification of Diseases (ICD)
      codes within the eMERGE database, 245 patients identified through ICD
      codes and medical record review within the Partners Biobank, and 243
      patients first presenting with unexplained inflammatory arthritis and
      with final diagnoses by record review within the Partners Biobank.
      Calibration of G-probabilities with disease status was high, with
      regression coefficients from 0.90 to 1.08 (1.00 is ideal).
      G-probabilities discriminated true diagnoses across the three cohorts
      with pooled areas under the curve (95% CI) of 0.69 (0.67 to 0.71), 0.81
      (0.76 to 0.84), and 0.84 (0.81 to 0.86), respectively. For all patients,
      at least one disease could be ruled out, and in 45% of patients, a likely
      diagnosis was identified with a 64% positive predictive value. In 35% of
      cases, the clinician's initial diagnosis was incorrect. Initial clinical
      diagnosis explained 39% of the variance in final disease, which improved
      to 51% (P < 0.0001) after adding G-probabilities. Converting genotype
      information before a clinical visit into an interpretable probability
      value for five different inflammatory arthritides could potentially be
      used to improve the diagnostic efficiency of rheumatic diseases in
      clinical practice.

TI  - CUX1 and IkappaBzeta (NFKBIZ) mediate the synergistic inflammatory
      response to TNF and IL-17A in stromal fibroblasts.
PG  - 5532-5541
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1912702117 [doi]
AB  - The role of stromal fibroblasts in chronic inflammation is unfolding. In
      rheumatoid arthritis, leukocyte-derived cytokines TNF and IL-17A work
      together, activating fibroblasts to become a dominant source of the
      hallmark cytokine IL-6. However, IL-17A alone has minimal effect on
      fibroblasts. To identify key mediators of the synergistic response to TNF
      and IL-17A in human synovial fibroblasts, we performed time series, dose-
      response, and gene-silencing transcriptomics experiments. Here we show
      that in combination with TNF, IL-17A selectively induces a specific set
      of genes mediated by factors including cut-like homeobox 1 (CUX1) and
      IkappaBzeta (NFKBIZ). In the promoters of CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL3, we
      found a putative CUX1-NF-kappaB binding motif not found elsewhere in the
      genome. CUX1 and NF-kappaB p65 mediate transcription of these genes
      independent of LIFR, STAT3, STAT4, and ELF3. Transcription of NFKBIZ,
      encoding the atypical IkappaB factor IkappaBzeta, is IL-17A dose-
      dependent, and IkappaBzeta only mediates the transcriptional response to
      TNF and IL-17A, but not to TNF alone. In fibroblasts, IL-17A response
      depends on CUX1 and IkappaBzeta to engage the NF-kappaB complex to
      produce chemoattractants for neutrophil and monocyte recruitment.

AB  - The emerging diversity of single-cell RNA-seq datasets allows for the
      full transcriptional characterization of cell types across a wide variety
      of biological and clinical conditions. However, it is challenging to
      analyze them together, particularly when datasets are assayed with
      different technologies, because biological and technical differences are
      interspersed. We present Harmony
      (https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony), an algorithm that projects
      cells into a shared embedding in which cells group by cell type rather
      than dataset-specific conditions. Harmony simultaneously accounts for
      multiple experimental and biological factors. In six analyses, we
      demonstrate the superior performance of Harmony to previously published
      algorithms while requiring fewer computational resources. Harmony enables
      the integration of ~10(6) cells on a personal computer. We apply Harmony
      to peripheral blood mononuclear cells from datasets with large
      experimental differences, five studies of pancreatic islet cells, mouse
      embryogenesis datasets and the integration of scRNA-seq with spatial
      transcriptomics data.

TI  - Defining inflammatory cell states in rheumatoid arthritis joint synovial
      tissues by integrating single-cell transcriptomics and mass cytometry.
PG  - 928-942
LID - 10.1038/s41590-019-0378-1 [doi]
AB  - To define the cell populations that drive joint inflammation in
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA), we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-
      seq), mass cytometry, bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and flow cytometry to
      T cells, B cells, monocytes, and fibroblasts from 51 samples of synovial
      tissue from patients with RA or osteoarthritis (OA). Utilizing an
      integrated strategy based on canonical correlation analysis of 5,265
      scRNA-seq profiles, we identified 18 unique cell populations. Combining
      mass cytometry and transcriptomics revealed cell states expanded in RA
      synovia: THY1(CD90)(+)HLA-DRA(hi) sublining fibroblasts, IL1B(+) pro-
      inflammatory monocytes, ITGAX(+)TBX21(+) autoimmune-associated B cells
      and PDCD1(+) peripheral helper T (TPH) cells and follicular helper T
      (TFH) cells. We defined distinct subsets of CD8(+) T cells characterized
      by GZMK(+), GZMB(+), and GNLY(+) phenotypes. We mapped inflammatory
      mediators to their source cell populations; for example, we attributed
      IL6 expression to THY1(+)HLA-DRA(hi) fibroblasts and IL1B production to
      pro-inflammatory monocytes. These populations are potentially key
      mediators of RA pathogenesis.
